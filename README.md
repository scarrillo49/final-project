## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Solution**: The issue was the missing JavaScript file needed to render the table. Adding the script tag for `transactions.js` in the HTML made the table show up.

### Challenge 2

**Problem**: Incorrect Date Format in Seed Data

**Solution**: Updated the seed data script to ensure all dates are entered in the correct format.

### Challenge 3

**Problem**: The transactions table was not updating after searches.

**Solution**: Modified the update function to completely clear and then correctly update the table data using the .empty() method.
